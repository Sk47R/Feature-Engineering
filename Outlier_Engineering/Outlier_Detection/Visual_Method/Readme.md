## Visual Methods

Data visualization is useful for data cleaning, exploring data, detecting outliers and unusual groups, identifying trends and clusters etc. Some plots used for detecting outliers are listed below

1. Box and whisker plot (box plot)

2. Scatter plot

3. Histogram

4. Distribution Plot

5. QQ plot

## Univariate method

In this method, we use only one feature to detect the outliers. This method looks for data points with extreme values on one variable. Plots like Box plot, Histogram and Distribution plot are used for univariate analysis.

Box plot is one of the simplest method for detecting outliers in a dataset. A box plot is a graphical display for describing the distributions of the data. Box plots use the median and the lower and upper quartiles.
