## Multivariate Imputation

The process of handling the missing values with the help of the feature column containing the missing value as well as other feature columns is called Multivariate Imputation.

For eg. Consider we have 3 features 'A', 'B' and 'C'. If the feature column 'A' has some missing values, then to fill those missing value we consider the feature column 'A' as well as other feature columns i.e. 'B' and 'C'.

### Ways to perform Multivariate Imputation

1. KNN Imputer.
2. Imputation by Chained Equation.
