## Engineering mixed variables

Mixed variables are those which values contain both numbers and labels. A mixed variable can contain numbers OR labels in different observations, or numbers AND labels in each observation.

For example, the variable vehicle registration is an example of letters and numbers combined in each observation (e.g., NK11DGX), whereas the variable number of missed payments , is an example of numbers or labels, where the values can be 0, 1, 2 or 3, or A and D.

## How can we engineer mixed variables?

We can sometimes derive meaningful features by extracting the categorical part in one variable and the numerical part in a different variable. Therefore, we obtain 2 variables from the original one. Then we proceed with the derived variables as we would do with any categorical or numerical variable.
