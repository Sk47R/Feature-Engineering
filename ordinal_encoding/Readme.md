## Ordinal Encoding

Ordinal Encoding is an encoding techinque used when the variables in the data are ordinal. Ordinal encoding converts each label into integer values and the encoded data represents the sequence of labels and that encoded data is fed to the Model.

This type of encoding is really only appropriate if there is a known relationship between the categories. This relationship does exist for some of the variables in the dataset, and ideally, this should be harnessed when preparing the data.

### Ordinal data:

It is a type of categorical data that consists of a set of orders or scales.

For example:

1. a list of patients consists of the level of sugar present in the body of a person which can be divided into high, low and medium classes.
2. Student's grade in an exam(A, B, C, D, Fail)

### Advantages:

1. It keeps the semantical information of the variable.
2. It is easy to understand and implement.

# Disadvantages

1. It doesn't add valuable information to the machine learning model
